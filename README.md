# *dbProxy: Secure, High-Performance Database Proxy*


dbProxy is a cross-platform server that serves as an intelligent intermediary between your database and the public internet. It delivers robust caching and authentication capabilities **without compromising the performance of critical database operations.**

It supports any database with a JDBC driver, including but not limited to Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL. dbProxy runs on any platform that supports Java applications or containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).

## **Why Choose dbProxy?**

dbProxy addresses the core challenge of enabling secure, authorized remote access to your database—without exposing it directly to the internet.

## **Performance Benefits**

Unlike cloud-dependent solutions, dbProxy **runs locally on your network**, on any device with database access. This ensures reliable operation **even without internet connectivity**, minimizing latency and eliminating external dependencies.


## **Security-First Design**

- **Passwords are hashed using modern, industry-standard algorithms**, ensuring protection against credential theft in the event of a breach.
- **JWT authentication support** for stateless, scalable sessions.
- Full control over access policies—no direct database exposure.

## **Optimized Caching**

Data is intelligently cached upon retrieval. Subsequent requests are served from the cache until refreshed, **dramatically reducing database load** while maintaining data freshness.

## **Database Experience Built for Speed**

- Eliminates the need for VPNs, SSH tunnels, or third-party remote access tools—even from mobile devices.
- **Minimal performance overhead** on your primary database.

## **Flexible Integration**
- Seamlessly integrates into **any existing database architecture.**
- Built in **Java**, enabling deployment on **all Java-supported platforms** and easy extension with any Java library or custom functionality.
